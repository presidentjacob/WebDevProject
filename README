We are naming our website "sort.io" 

We are going to make a general collection database website to keep track of anything that
you may want. We plan to have a feature where there could be different tabs for different
collections, so it doesn't limit what the collection may be of (ex. one collection could be
movies, another CD's, another being collector's cards, etc). This could be possible if when
entering an item, you would just need a picture taken by the user and then you could
choose to add a description, rating, number of that item, value, and which collection it'll
go in. We also plan on implementing APIs to remove the need of taking photos. There are
a lot of database collection applications that are specific to different things on app stores
(for example, CLZ.com for CD's, Letterboxd for movies, etc). However, I do not know of
one that can encompass multiple medias.

Due to the feature that lets you add any type of collection you'd like, everyone at every
age can use this (as long as they have a collection of something). No matter if it's
Pokémon cards or fancy plates, anyone with a collection can keep track of what they
own. Each person could have a login so we can store individual data.

Features: Possible to add multiple collections of any item. For each object added to a
collection, we will add a description, rating, number of that item, value, and which
collection it'll go in. Of course, make these optional to fill out in case it doesn't apply to
that collection specifically.
